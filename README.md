```

3. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Default Admin Credentials

The system comes pre-populated with these admin accounts:

- Username: `admin1` / Password: `password123`
- Username: `admin2` / Password: `password456`

## API Routes

### Authentication
- `POST /api/login` - Admin login

### Events
- `GET /api/events` - Get all events
- `GET /api/events/{event_id}` - Get event details
- `POST /api/events` - Create event (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/events/{event_id}` - Delete event (admin only)

### Registration
- `POST /api/register/{event_id}` - Register for an event
- `GET /api/confirmation/{registration_id}` - Get registration confirmation

## Project Overview

*College Connect* is a platform that allows event management and registration for students. The system has two main interfaces: *Admin* and *User* (Student).

### Admin Interface

The *Admin* has exclusive login access, which allows them to:

•⁠  ⁠*Add Events*: Admins can add new events, specifying the event name, venue, and event details.
•⁠  ⁠*View/Delete Events: Admins can view the number of registrations for each event or delete events. The **View* option allows the admin to see the number of registrations and download the registration data as a CSV file.
•⁠  ⁠*Admin Access Control*: Only two hardcoded admin accounts (Admin 1 and Admin 2) are authorized to manage events.

Once logged in, the admin can monitor registrations for each event and download a CSV file with registration details.

### User Interface

Once the admin logs out, the events are displayed to users on the *Dashboard*. Students can:

•⁠  ⁠*Register for Events*: Users can click the "Register Event" button to sign up for an event, providing their name, email, and student ID.
•⁠  ⁠*Print Registration Form*: After successful registration, users can print a confirmation form with their event details.

### Summary of How the System Works

1.⁠ ⁠The admin logs in to manage events.
2.⁠ ⁠Admin can add, view, or delete events, with the ability to download registration details in CSV format.
3.⁠ ⁠After the admin logs out, the events are displayed for students to view and register.
4.⁠ ⁠Students register by providing their details, and after successful registration, they receive a confirmation form.

This simple workflow provides a streamlined event management and registration process for both event organizers and participants.
