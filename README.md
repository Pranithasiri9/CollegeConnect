# College Event Registration Web App

A full-stack web application for managing and registering for college events.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (with Vite) + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based system

## Features

- Event browsing by categories (Cultural, Sports, Technical, etc.)
- Event registration with confirmation pages
- Admin authentication and dashboard
- Event creation and management
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.8+)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run backend
```

2. Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Or start both with:

```bash
npm start
```

## Default Admin Credentials

The system comes pre-populated with these admin accounts:

- Username: `admin1` / Password: `password123`
- Username: `admin2` / Password: `password456`

## API Routes

### Authentication
- `POST /api/login` - Admin login

### Events
- `GET /api/events` - Get all events
- `GET /api/events/{event_id}` - Get event details
- `POST /api/events` - Create event (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/events/{event_id}` - Delete event (admin only)

### Registration
- `POST /api/register/{event_id}` - Register for an event
- `GET /api/confirmation/{registration_id}` - Get registration confirmation

## Project Overview

*College Connect* is a platform that allows event management and registration for students. The system has two main interfaces: *Admin* and *User* (Student).

### Admin Interface

The *Admin* has exclusive login access, which allows them to:

•⁠  ⁠*Add Events*: Admins can add new events, specifying the event name, venue, and event details.
•⁠  ⁠*View/Delete Events: Admins can view the number of registrations for each event or delete events. The **View* option allows the admin to see the number of registrations and download the registration data as a CSV file.
•⁠  ⁠*Admin Access Control*: Only two hardcoded admin accounts (Admin 1 and Admin 2) are authorized to manage events.

Once logged in, the admin can monitor registrations for each event and download a CSV file with registration details.

### User Interface

Once the admin logs out, the events are displayed to users on the *Dashboard*. Students can:

•⁠  ⁠*Register for Events*: Users can click the "Register Event" button to sign up for an event, providing their name, email, and student ID.
•⁠  ⁠*Print Registration Form*: After successful registration, users can print a confirmation form with their event details.

### Summary of How the System Works

1.⁠ ⁠The admin logs in to manage events.
2.⁠ ⁠Admin can add, view, or delete events, with the ability to download registration details in CSV format.
3.⁠ ⁠After the admin logs out, the events are displayed for students to view and register.
4.⁠ ⁠Students register by providing their details, and after successful registration, they receive a confirmation form.

This simple workflow provides a streamlined event management and registration process for both event organizers and participants.

### Problem Statement:
Event Management.
Website that will help in planning and organizing campus events. 
Should be able to help in keeping track of expenses, scheduling of 
different shows at different venues etc. Send alerts to interested 
students before the event starts
